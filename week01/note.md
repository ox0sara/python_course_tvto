# 📚 Week01 Summary – Python Basics

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🔁 Session 3: Loop Structures

- Learned the two main types of loops in Python:
  - `for` loop: used to iterate over sequences like lists, strings, and ranges.
  - `while` loop: continues as long as a condition is true.
- Practiced basic loop syntax and structure.
- Introduced control statements:
  - `break`: exits the loop early.
  - `continue`: skips the current iteration.
  - `pass`: does nothing, used as a placeholder.
- Applied loops to real tasks such as skipping specific numbers and handling user input repeatedly.

### 🔂 Session 4: Nested Loops & Output Control

- Learned how to use **nested loops** to build patterns like multiplication tables.
- Gained control over `print()` formatting using:
  - `sep`: custom separator between printed items.
  - `end`: control what happens at the end of each print (e.g., stay on same line).
- Learned to use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multiline strings.
- Practiced:
  - Summing two-digit even numbers.
  - Calculating absolute values.
  - Generating multiplication tables with nested loops.

## 📌 Focus
By the end of Week 01, I became confident using loops, understood how to format output, and started solving beginner-level logic problems in Python.
