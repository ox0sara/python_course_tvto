## 🧪 Session 2 – Working with Conditions in Python

This session focused on learning the basics of Python programming, including data types, operators, and conditional statements.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- 🔢 Converting user input to numeric types using `int()` and `float()`
- ⌨️ Taking input from users using `input()`
- 🧠 Writing conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- 📊 Using comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- 🔗 Combining multiple conditions using logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`

### 📝 Practice Projects

1. **Check if a Number is Greater Than 10**  
   The program asks the user for a number and tells them if it's greater than 10.

2. **Registration Eligibility Based on Age**  
   The program checks if the user's age qualifies them to register (e.g., age ≥ 18).

3. **Student Score Level Checker**  
   The program evaluates a student's performance based on their score and categorizes it as:
   - Excellent (18–20)
   - Good (15–17)
   - Mid (14–15)
   - Needs Improvement (0–12)
