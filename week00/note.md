## 🗓️ Session 1: Getting Started with Python

### ✅ What I Learned

- Understood Python file naming rules:
  - Start with a letter
  - Avoid spaces and special characters
  - Use `.py` extension

## 🗓️ Session 2: Conditional Statements

### ✅ What I Learned

- Took input from users and converted it to `int` or `float` types
- Used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to build conditional logic
- Practiced comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Combined conditions using logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`

### 💡 Practice Examples

- Checked if a number is greater than 10
- Determined user eligibility based on age
- Built a student score evaluator:
  - Excellent: 18–20  
  - Good: 15–17  
  - Mid: 14–15  
  - Needs Improvement: below 14
